Adonis-mqtt is a provider to integrate MQTT in your app. This is useful when developing an IOT application, or need a simple message broker.

## Features
- MQTT Connection using mqtt.js

- Included CLI generator for MqttListener classes

## Roadmap
These are the features that I still want to developing in the near future.

- Check SSL support (currently untested)
- Improve tests and documentation

```bash
adonis install adonis-mqtt
```

See [instructions.md](instructions.md) for configuration and usage.

## Special Thanks

The code of [adonis-scheduler](https://github.com/nrempel/adonis-scheduler/) was a great example in many ways. This helped me tremendously.
